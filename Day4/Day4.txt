Understanding Django Apps
Working with Views in Django


Django is high-level, opensource web framework written in Python.

DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)

Lab1: Creating blank web project in Django
==============================================

1. Create a folder named mysite in Desktop
2. Open VSCode > Terminal
3. Ensure your present working directory is pointing to the mysite directory in Desktop
4. Type the following command to create the project

	django-admin startproject mysite

5. Lets now test if the project is working or not. For that we will be spinning a development server. To launch the dev server type the following command:

	python manage.py runserver

Once server is launched, you can access your project by accessing the following link in the browser

	http://127.0.0.1:8000


Lab2: Creating an app in the web project
=========================================

To create an app run the following command

	python manage.py startapp food

This will create a seperate app which holds the blank framework to create app


Lab3: Creating Views for food app
==================================

Here we will create a new view that displays hello world

1. Go to views.py in food app

2. Write the following code 

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
	return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello World! </h1>")


3. To make the view accessible we need to link this particular view to a particular URL. This is done by using a file named urls.py. So create urls.py inside food app

4. Write the following code for urls.py (This file is responsible to setup url pattern for accessing index function inside views.py)


from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns=[
    path('',views.index, name='index'),
]

5. Now once url pattern is generated, we need to inform django project that this urls.py exists. To do so we need to attach this to main site

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("food/",include('food.urls')),
]

6. Now start the server (incase server not running)

	python manage.py runserver


7. Try accessing app using the following link the browser

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/food
